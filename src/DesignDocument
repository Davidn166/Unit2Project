Step 1:Ask the user to enter the first coordinate
Step 2:Ask the user to enter the second coordinate
Step 3:list out the first coordinate
step 4:list out the second coordinate
step 5:use calculateSlope() to print out the slope of the line using the first two coordinates
step 6:print out the y-intercept of the line using the first two coordinates
step 7:print out the slope intercept equation using the first two coordinates
step 8:print out the distance between the two points using the first two coordinates
step 9:ask the user to enter a x value
step 10: solve for the coordinate point by using the x value and the first two coordinates
